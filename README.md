# codeacademy sql: metropolitan museum of art

The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York is one of the world’s largest and finest art museums.
In this project, I will be working with a table named _met_ that contains the museum’s collection of American Decorative Arts.
It has the following columns:

id - the title of the art piece

department - the department of the art piece

category - the category of the art piece

title - the title name of the art piece

artist - the name of the artist

date - the date(s) of the art piece

medium - the medium of the art piece

country - the country of the artist

This data was kindly made publicly available under the Open Access Policy.

Let’s get started!
